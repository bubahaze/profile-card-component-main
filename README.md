## My process

No big philosophy, casting spells on the VSCode, and observing changes on browser's window. If I' ve been stuck, I was doing a research on particular issues, i.e. flexbox, positioning etc. (MDN Docs, devdocs, YouTube tutorials).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code


### What I learned

Obviously a lot, as it is my first completed project in HTML/CSS ðŸ˜†. Among these things is Flexbox, overflow property, basic Sass...

### Continued development

As it is my first attempt of pre-processing CSS with Sass, I'd like to deepen this area, as I find Sass extremely useful and handy ðŸ™Œ. Media query is the next issue I'd love to particularly master ðŸ”¬. Additionally, my aim is to homogenise CSS units, so there are coherent and suitable for various viewports.
